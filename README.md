# Sample Code for the XL9535KxVxx Multi-Relay Board

I had huge problems finding sample code for this board online, so if you're looking for some, here it is!  

Bases on the code the supplier sent to this person in a github-issue: https://github.com/esphome/esphome/discussions/5710#discussion-5830573

That however didn't work, so me and ChatGPT did some fixes.

The Multi-Relay-Board in Question is this: https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006142513530.html
